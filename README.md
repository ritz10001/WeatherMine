### Project Description
This project features a weather app that functions through an API response from AccuWeather and outputs the result via an aesthetic GUI. It primarily makes use of object oriented programming which includes classes, and some basic inheritance for the GUI elements alongside deserialization of data and some basic web scraping.

### Installation
After downloading the WeatherMine folder and requirements.txt, execute this in your terminal:
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

### Warning(s)
You may notice that the icons and widgets that appear on your screen may not be in proper alignment. This issue depends on the resolution of the computer, and may appear differently on different systems. If this happens, I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do about this from my end.
Additionally, we are limited to only 25 API calls per 24 hours, so the app may not work once the limit has for the day has been exceeded, but we hope to resolve this in the future.
